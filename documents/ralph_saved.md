Read '/Users/antran/Projects/iOS/Indie/DotLife/documents/DotLife_Moments_MVP_PRD.md' and '/Users/antran/Projects/iOS/Indie/DotLife/documents/DotLife_Technical_Design_Tuist_SPM.md' to understand the requirement. Read '/Users/antran/Projects/iOS/Indie/DotLife/.claude/task_state.txt' to get the current filename of the todo file. Read the corresponding todo file in the '/Users/antran/Projects/iOS/Indie/DotLife/documents/todo' folder. Implement all the tasks in this todo file. Verify all acceptance criteria in the todo file. Iterate on the task until you have evidence for all acceptance criteria. Mark all tasks and acceptance criteria as done. Replace the text in '/Users/antran/Projects/iOS/Indie/DotLife/.claude/task_state.txt' with the file name of the next todo file. And proceed to that file following the same workflow above. Loop until there is no more todo file to process. Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when done.
